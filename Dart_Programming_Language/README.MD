# Overview Of Dart
* __Dart__ is a open source programming language development of web and mobile applications. It is developed by Google.

# Dart SDK
* __Dart SDK__ has the libraries and command-line tools that you need to develop Dart command-line, server, and non-Flutter web apps. If you’re developing __Flutter apps__, then you don’t need to separately download the Dart SDK; just [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

* The __Dart SDK__ includes a __lib__ directory for the [Dart libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/library-tour) and a __bin__ directory that has these command-line tools:
    - [dart](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-tool): The command-line interface for creating, formatting, analyzing, testing, documenting, compiling, and running Dart code.
